# API (v1.3)
TBMiner have a small built-in read only api.

The api is used for profit switching miners or other systems
which requires basic knownledge of whats going on in the miner.

## Default values
- Default ip is 127.0.0.1
- Default port is 4068.

## Available api commands
- help -- Overview of available commands.
- miner -- Basic information about the miner and a totals overview.
- threads -- Stats for all working gpu threads.
- pool -- Information about the pool in use.
- summary -- Miner, threads and pool info (all above)

# API (v1.4)

This is a small update on the API:

    - Threads now contain algorithm.
    - There can be more than one thread per GPU with dualmining.
    - There can be more than one pool with dualmining.
    - Data should be valid Json data.
