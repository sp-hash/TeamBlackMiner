# Mine Vertcoin with Team Black Miner

## General

Vertcoin was added in Team Black Miner v1.64 or later

First time you run it will generate the **verthash.dat** file neccesary for mining vertcoin.

Keep this file so you have it in the folder at the next run.

Filesize is about 1.3 GB. Vertcoin can be mined on GPU's with 2GB memory or more.

## Linux

```bash
$ ./tbminer_hashalot_vtc.sh
```

(Or you can use the **start_vtc_hashalot+zil.sh** start script)

And one for TBMiner:

```bash
$ ./tbminer_miningpoolhub_vtc.sh
```

## Windows

There are three pool run scripts
+ start_hashalot_vtc.bat
+ start_miningpoolhub_vtc.bat

Change it if you want to use another pool and remember your Vertcoin wallet.
